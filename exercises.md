### What types of writing do you do (ie fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other)?
Creative non fiction and poetry. I haven't attempted fiction for a while. 



### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
Much of my writing begins as scraps of sentences typed quickly into my Notes app. These often come to me after overhearing or participating in conversations, or observing people out in the street. I rarely handwrite, despite my compulsive thoughts that I'm letting myself down by not doing it. When I give in, it's usually in a park, or cosied up in bed- not often is it casual. It can be helpful to relenquish some grammatical correctedness with the slip of my biro. When I hand write, it's often hurried, nonsensical and theraputic. Therefore it's not entirely useful as a productive writing effort unless I sift through my unreadable handwriting for fragments of ideas or phrases I might feel particularly attached to. One technique which can sometimes inhibit my writing is getting too caught up in reading similar pieces, thematically or in form, for inspiration. I can find myself unable to write originally and then feeling dejected. The blank page of a word document can also be intimidating, however the practice of closing my eyes and furiously typing whatever comes to mind helps ease the emptiness of the blank space. 

### Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
These techniques have become engrained into my thought process about writing and have emerged over the course of a few years. Some are desperate attempts when things are dire, like the loud Lo-fi instrumental study beats I play to block out any background noise. However, when my concentration is at an all time low, I tend to drift off into the music, and find myself further from myself than ever. This is to say they are not always effective, but encourage space to sit and think and write.

### How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?
Depending on mood or circumstance, these tools and techniques have varying degrees of helpfulness. Why I use them at all, then, is to recognise that writing is a practice, and quite a phsyical one at that. To sit at a clean desk is a purposeful move and one of intent. This alone makes me a writer, or so I tell myself. Propping myself up on a pillow and scribbling into a notebook late at night has the same effect. This is less of a considered practice and more of a fiery need to express myself. Both these techniques- the environment in which I create for myself to write in, the music I play or not, the clothes I wear, or the snacks I have next to me, help ease the process of writing and settle me into the moment. They give me an hour or more to sit, and simply write.
